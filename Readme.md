Installation
-------------------------
__Install Node.js and npm__
- First we need to download Node.js and npm from this site:
[click on me](https://nodejs.org/ru/) 
- Then we will need to go to the command line, I recommend using GitBash, because of its functionality. [click on me](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Then you need to create a folder in which we will have the project
- Then just go to this folder using the command line and the command ```cd```
- After going to the folder, you need to register the command that will create our application: ```create-react-app file name```
- After creation, you will have a folder with your application files, go to it with the command ``cd folder name```.
- The last step is to start our application with the command ```npm start```
